This document and script are for Apartment scenario: Painting walls

Imagine you have to design a robot system, which is supposed to paint the walls of a room with furniture in it. Take care not to get paint on the furniture or floor and not to interfere with people who might enter the room at any point.

The document explains briefly in all aspects of the scenario like,
1. Which knowledge does the robot need?
2. Which hardware modules are necessary (e.g. sensors, wheels)?
3. What kind of capacities does the robot need in terms of perception, reasoning or motion planning?

The script contains a 2D simulation of the robot doing wall painting and all other foreign objects like furniture, person etc..,
